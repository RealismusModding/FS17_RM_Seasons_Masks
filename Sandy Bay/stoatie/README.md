# Sandy Bay snow mask

Created by Stoatie

These are the files you need to add to your map01 folder of SandyBay17pc to have a basic snow mask without having to use Giants Editor.
All buildings that you can enter and the train tracks are masked. (I think)
You still need to follow the Info for map makers instructions for adding the foliage to your map through Notepad++

Update:
Main roads are now masked, not lanes or single roads.
Parts of sales yards masked
Field 25 masked
Outside feeding troughs masked
WARNING: DO NOT ENTER ANY FIELD ON SOUTHERN BORDER WHEN THERE IS SNOW ON THE MAP. Map issue not seasons related.
